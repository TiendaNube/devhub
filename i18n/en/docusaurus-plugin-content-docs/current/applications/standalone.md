# External Applications

External applications, unlike [integrated applications](./native.md) that appear in the Merchant's Admin, are independent solutions that load outside of the Merchant's Admin. They operate autonomously and can cover a wide range of functionalities, from marketing to inventory management.

## Getting Started with Development

### Developing from a Template

Our development tools at Nuvemshop include [ready-made templates for app creation](../developer-tools/templates#tipos-de-template), which cover all the logic of [authentication](../applications/overview#autenticando-seu-aplicativo) and construction.

After selecting the desired template, we recommend reviewing the **"README.md"** file in the corresponding repository. There, you will find detailed guidance and practical steps to make the most of the capabilities offered by our development models.

### Developing without Using Our Template

On the other hand, if you choose not to use our templates, you can access this [guide](./authentication.md) for manual integration. Our goal is to facilitate the development of your application, regardless of the path you choose.

## Recommendations

- We recommend using our [Nimbus Design System](../developer-tools/nimbus.md) to streamline the construction of your app's interface. It comes with a kit of ready-to-use components. You can also create your own [theme](https://nimbus.nuvemshop.com.br/documentation/resources/themes) to establish your brand's visual identity.
- We recommend following the UX/UI concepts defined by our design team. [Access the complete guide here](../design-guidelines/overview.md).
- For apps published in our app store, we recommend reviewing our [homologation checklist](../homologation/overview.md).
