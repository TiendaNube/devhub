## Naming Apps and Screens

### Naming Apps

Choosing the name of an app is crucial for its identity and visibility. Below are some essential aspects to consider when selecting a name that effectively connects with users and the market:

**Clarity and Relevance:** The name should be clear, relevant to the app's function, and convey its purpose directly.

**Simplicity and Memorability:** Opt for a simple name, easy to pronounce, and memorable for users.

**Originality and Differentiation:** Choose a unique name to avoid confusion with other apps and create a distinctive brand identity.

**Consistency with the Proposal:** The name should reflect the app's proposal, create a logical connection with its features and values.

**Legality and Availability:** Verify that the name does not infringe on existing copyrights or trademarks and is available as a domain and on social media.

### Naming Screens

The choice of the page's name should consider contextual information. Titles are meant to summarize and contextualize what the user will find in the interface and should not be related to the app's name.

Ideally, we should use a verb (imperative or infinitive) to summarize the action to be taken in the interface.

- We can use only nouns that provide context about the moment of the experience.
- It's important that it's self-explanatory (it works on its own).
- Preferably, use only one sentence.
- We don't use a period at the end to finish the sentence.
- We can use exclamation or question marks depending on the case.

## Nuvemshop Tone of Voice

Our voice is consistent and reflects our brand identity. It remains unchanged, conveying our distinctive personality. On the other hand, the tone we adopt may vary depending on the situation. This distinction between voice and tone allows us to maintain essential consistency while adjusting our message to fit the specific context.
