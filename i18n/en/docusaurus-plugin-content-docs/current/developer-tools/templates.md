# App Templates

We provide application templates that serve as a foundation to kickstart and expedite the development process. These templates are divided into two main categories: integrated and external applications. Each category has its own specific models, designed to meet various needs and scenarios.

Currently, the templates have a React frontend structure and a Node.js backend for both categories. It's essential to note that, in the context of integrated applications, React is fundamental for the frontend, as our Nimbus design system is a prerequisite and optimized to work exclusively with React technology.

To deepen your understanding of creating and deploying applications using our templates, we recommend reviewing the "README.md" file in the template repository. There, you'll find detailed guidance and practical steps to make the most of the capabilities offered by our development models.
